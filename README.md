# TeamCode

TeamCode is the code we use on our robot, SirvoBot.  Right now we are about ~800 lines in and we have plenty to go.  This file will be updated to tell people who view our github what is going on.

Right now our too programmers, Reece and Zach, are working on an autonomous period.  Reece just added gyroscopes, color sensors, and distance sensors into our hardware file so we can now tell distance to a certain color, and accurately drive to it
